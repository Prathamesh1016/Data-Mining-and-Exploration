Data Mining and Exploration

✅️Created a transactional database and loaded multiple XML files  using R  scripts. XML loads correctly (with validation if DTD required), loaded from a folder.

✅️ Data is extracted from XMLs and loaded properly in local SQLite database. 

✅️ Created a MySQL database on AWS cloud and created a star schema in that database with a new script with fact tables and dimension tables. Data loads reasonably fast from SQLite database into MySQL.

✅️Data exploration and reporting with analytical queries using R notebooks covering the sales , representative rankings and so on. 

✅️Overall, the project demonstrates exemplary performance in most aspects, with strong attention to detail, proper organization, and effective data handling techniques.
